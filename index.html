        <h2>5 Facts About Che Guevara</h2>
        <h4>1. HE WAS PART IRISH.</h4>
        <p>Che&#8218;s great-great-great-great-grandfather was Patrick Lynch, who emigrated from Ireland to what is now Argentina in the <strong>1700</strong> His father, Ernesto Guevara Lynch, has been quoted as saying, 
            "The first thing to note is that in my son's veins flowed the blood of the Irish rebels." The other side of the family was Basque; according to Guevara&#8218;s brother Juan, their father was drawn
             to the rebellious elements of both sides of the family tree, but particularly appreciated the Irish love of a good party. In <strong>2017</strong>, Ireland&#8218;s postal service, An Post, issued a stamp commemorating
              Che using Dublin artist Jim Fitzpatrick&#8218;s iconic red, black, and white image of the revolutionary.</p>
        <h4>2. HE WAS PASSIONATE ABOUT PLAYING RUGBY.</h4>
        <p>His parents were members of the San Isidro rugby club, for which Che played scrum-half in his youth. In <strong>1951</strong> he published his own magazine dedicated to the sport, called Tackle. The only problem with
             playing? He suffered from asthma his entire life. His father tried to convince him to quit the sport because of it, but Che responded, “I love rugby. Even if it kills me one day, I am happy to play it.”</p>
        <h4>3. HE LOVED POETRY.</h4>
        <p>Because of his asthma, Che was home-schooled, and it was there that he was first introduced to the poetry he would come to love for the rest of his life. At his death, he was carrying a weathered green book
             of poetry that he&#8218;d copied by hand, featuring work from Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, Peruvian poet Cesar Vallejo, and Cuban poet Nicolás Guillén. He was also a fan of Walt Whitman, John Keats, and more.</p>
        <h4>4. HIS NICKNAME COMES FROM A DIALECTICAL TIC.</h4>
        <p>Short, sharp, and memorable, Che is also an Argentine interjection that Guevara used so often his Cuban compatriots branded him with it. It&#8218;s a filler word, something like saying dude, mate, or pal. If he&#8218;d
             been Canadian, his nickname might have been Eh.</p>
        <h4>5. HE STUDIED MEDICINE.</h4>
        <p>Influenced by his struggles with asthma, Che enrolled in Buenos Aires University to study medicine in <strong>1948</strong>. After graduating as a physician in <strong>1953</strong>, he did an internship at Mexico City's General Hospital, where he 
            carried out allergy research, but left in <strong>1955</strong> to join Fidel and Raul Castro&#8218;s Cuban Revolution as their doctor.</p>
